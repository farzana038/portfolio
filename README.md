# Farzana Jamal — Portfolio Website

This is a simple, single‑page portfolio site built from your provided document. It keeps the smooth feel of Rishab Mishra’s website **without** the skill/progress bars.

## What's inside
- `index.html` — All sections: **Home, About, Resume, Projects, Collaborators, Contact** (top‑right navigation)
- `style.css` — Dark lavender background, black text, clean layout
- `cv.pdf` — Your uploaded CV, previewed in the Resume section, and downloadable
- `images/` — Placeholder folder containing your photo (not displayed on the site per your instruction)
  
## Key features
- Smooth scrolling and section reveal on scroll
- “Geographer” then “Researcher” shown **one after another** in the hero banner
- Top‑right navigation that highlights the active section
- Work experience and collaborators presented **side‑by‑side** on wide screens with icons (Font Awesome)
- No yellow hover effects; links/buttons stay on black theme
- No skill bars

## How to use
1. Download the zip and extract it anywhere on your computer.
2. Double‑click **index.html** to open it in your browser.
3. To update any text, edit `index.html` with a simple editor (Notepad, VS Code).
4. To change colors or spacing, edit `style.css`.
5. To replace the CV, overwrite `cv.pdf` with a new file of the same name.
